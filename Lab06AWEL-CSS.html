        <li>Examine your motives. Make sure that you have a passion for owning a business and for this particular business.</li>
        <li>Be willing to commit to the hours, discipline, continuous leaming and the frustrations of owning your own business.</li>
        <li>Conduct a competitive analysis in your market, including products, prices, promotions, advertising,

    <h2 class="secondheading">Tips on Building a Sound Business Plan</h2>
    <ol class="ordered_list">
        <li>Write a business plan with a complete financial and marketing plan.</li>
        <li>Your marketing strategy should be built around your strengths, your competitor's weaknesses and your
            customers' desires.</li>
        <li>Test the reality of your business-know why it will work and how you will make it work. Think your business
            through step by step.</li>
        <li>Allow at least two hours every week for thinking and planning. Do not allow anything to interfere with this
            time. You run the business. Don't let it run you.</li>
        <li>Establish an annual operating plan. Review it and update it monthly with appropriate employees.</li>
